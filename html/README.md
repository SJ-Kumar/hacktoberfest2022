HTML  is hypertext-markup-language.
It is the standard markup language for creating webpages.
"Markup" refers to how HTML “marks up” the page with annotations within the HTML file.
With HTML, not only can you format documents with headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements — you can also embed images, 
videos, audio files, and other multimedia via hyperlinks. 
And, you can link to other web pages on the same website or from another site. 
This allows visitors to easily navigate your website and jump between websites stored on different web servers.

basic syntax of html for beginners to start with(HTML boilerplate):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title></title>

</head>
<body>
   
    
</body>
</html>

Explanation of the above code:
All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
The <html lang="en"> only specifies the language code of the page meaning en or English is used for all the text on the page.
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

<title> (required in every HTML document)
<style>
<base>
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>

The <body> tag defines the document's body. The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.
